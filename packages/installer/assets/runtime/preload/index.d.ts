/**
 * Renderer preload entry. Runs in an isolated world before Codex's page JS.
 * Responsibilities:
 *   1. Install a React DevTools-shaped global hook to capture the renderer
 *      reference when React mounts. We use this for fiber walking.
 *   2. After DOMContentLoaded, kick off settings-injection logic.
 *   3. Discover renderer-scoped tweaks (via IPC to main) and start them.
 *   4. Listen for `codexpp:tweaks-changed` from main (filesystem watcher) and
 *      hot-reload tweaks without dropping the page.
