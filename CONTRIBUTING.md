## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run audit
```

The installer package is `packages/installer` and publishes the `codex-plusplus` CLI. Runtime code lives in `packages/runtime`; public tweak author types live in `packages/sdk`.

Default tweaks are developed and released from their own repositories. The installer fetches their latest GitHub releases during first install; do not vendor their source into this repository.

## Release Checklist

1. Update package versions using semver.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Run `npm run audit`.
5. Test `codex-plusplus install`, `doctor`, `repair`, and `uninstall` on a real Codex install for the target platform.
6. Create a GitHub release with a semver tag.
