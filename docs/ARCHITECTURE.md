## Tweak update checks

Tweak updates are deliberately advisory. `manifest.json` must include `githubRepo` in `owner/repo` form. The main process checks GitHub Releases at most once per day per tweak and caches the result in `<user-data-dir>/state.json`.

The renderer only receives cached metadata (`latestVersion`, `releaseUrl`, `updateAvailable`) and can open the GitHub release for review. There is no automatic download, install, or replacement path in the runtime.

## Boot sequence

1. User launches Codex.app.
2. macOS verifies the (re-signed) ad-hoc signature → Gatekeeper allows launch.
3. The desktop runtime reads `Info.plist` → checks asar integrity hash.
   - The hash now matches the patched asar, so this passes.
   - On older Electron-style bundles, the `EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation`
     fuse may also be off as a belt-and-suspenders measure.
4. Electron loads the asar's `package.json#main`, which now points to `codex-plusplus-loader.cjs`.
5. The loader (in the asar):
   - Reads `__codexpp.userRoot` from package.json.
   - Sets `CODEX_PLUSPLUS_USER_ROOT` and `CODEX_PLUSPLUS_RUNTIME` envs.
   - `require()`s `<userRoot>/runtime/main.js`.
   - `require()`s the original `__codexpp.originalMain` (Codex's real entry).
6. Runtime's `main.js`:
   - Registers our preload via Electron-compatible session APIs (additive —
     Codex's own preload still runs).
   - Discovers tweaks under `<userRoot>/tweaks`.
   - Starts main-scoped tweaks immediately.
   - Sets up IPC handlers.
7. Codex creates its `BrowserWindow`. Both Codex's preload AND our preload run in each renderer.
8. Our preload:
   - Installs a React DevTools-shaped global hook (so we can fiber-walk later).
   - Asks main for the tweak list and user paths over IPC.
   - For each renderer-scoped tweak, `require()`s its entry and calls `start(api)`.
   - Starts the Settings injector (MutationObserver waiting for the Settings dialog).
   - Mounts the built-in Tweak Manager section.
9. When the user opens Settings, our injector:
   - Detects the Radix `[role="dialog"]` matching "Settings".
   - Appends a "Tweaks" tab to the dialog's `[role="tablist"]`.
   - Creates a sibling content panel that shows registered sections when the tab is clicked, and hides itself when other tabs are clicked.

## Why these choices

### Why patch asar entry instead of always using the fuse?

The fuse alone would let us swap in a new asar, but Codex's asar is large (~115 MB) — pointlessly recopying it every install/update is slow. Patching the entry adds ~1 KB. We do flip the fuse anyway as a safety net: if a future Codex update brings asar integrity back via a different mechanism, the fuse still neutralizes it.

### Why local re-signing instead of disabling SIP?

Re-signing is local-only, reversible, and doesn't compromise system security. On macOS, Codex++ creates and reuses a per-machine "Codex++ Local Signing" identity so privacy grants have a stable signer across repair runs. Users can still opt into ad-hoc signing with `--no-local-signing`. We never touch SIP, hardened runtime, or kernel-level protections.

### Why a preload, not source-patching the React tree?

Codex is a Vite/Rollup build with a single entry chunk and no module registry exposed at runtime — there's no `webpackChunk` trick. String-patching the minified output is brittle (every Codex release changes the build). Preload + DOM observation is decoupled from Codex's bundle structure: we only depend on stable affordances (Radix attributes, `[role="dialog"]`, etc.), so most Codex updates just work.

### Why a separate runtime in user-dir?

So you can iterate on tweaks (and even on the runtime itself) without re-running the installer. The installer's job is the one-time "punch a hole in the bundle"; everything else lives outside.

### What about Owl?

Current Codex builds use Owl: a native Codex shell with a Chromium framework and
an Electron-compatible JavaScript runtime. Codex++ still patches `app.asar` and
still uses Electron-compatible APIs such as `app`, `BrowserWindow`, `session`,
`ipcMain`, and `ipcRenderer`, but there is no `Electron Framework.framework` in
the current macOS bundle. See [Owl runtime surface](./OWL-RUNTIME.md) for the
observed private APIs.

### Why additive session preloads instead of `webPreferences.preload`?

`webPreferences.preload` is a single string; setting it would replace Codex's
own preload and break the app. The runtime uses
`session.registerPreloadScript()` when available and falls back to
`session.setPreloads()` on older Electron-compatible builds.

## App modes: ChatGPT ⇄ Tweakers (bundle swap)

`/Applications/ChatGPT.app` runs in exactly one of two modes, switched by
swapping the entire payload at that path:

- **chatgpt** — the byte-identical pristine OpenAI Developer-ID bundle is
  live. Genuine Sparkle, Gatekeeper notarization, and the Chrome-extension
  bridge all work; no Tweakers code is injected. The patched payload is
  parked in the payload store (`<user-data-dir>/mode/patched-payload/`).
- **tweakers** — the patched, contained-signed bundle is live and the
  injected runtime, tweaks, and settings UI are active. The pristine payload
  is preserved as the DevID-verified backup (`<user-data-dir>/backup/`).

Both payloads keep the same bundle id and `productName`, so profile/login
state is shared across modes. Switching is owned by the installer CLI —
`tweakers mode <chatgpt|tweakers|status>` — which confirms (unless `--yes`),
quits the app, swaps bundles transactionally (the app path is never empty),
and relaunches. The in-app App Mode control (Settings → Config, tweakers mode
only) confirms in the renderer and then hands the same CLI off via a launchd
job so the helper survives the app quitting and the bundle swap.

The persistent menu-bar switcher exposes mode changes in both modes. While
Tweakers mode is active, it also offers **Reload Tweakers with Latest Changes**.
That action resolves the registered development checkout and starts
`refresh-local --source development`: the checkout is built and a disposable
candidate is validated while ChatGPT stays open, then the app is quit only for
the transactional promotion and relaunch. A failed promotion restores the
previous working payload.

Mode discipline:

- In chatgpt mode the watcher, `repair`, `install`, and `refresh-local` all
  stand down — the `tweakers mode` command is the **only** sanctioned way the
  official app path is ever patched, and chatgpt mode is always a
  byte-identical DevID restore away.
- Alternating signers on one bundle id means some macOS TCC permissions
  (Accessibility, Screen Recording) may need re-granting after a switch; the
  confirmation copy discloses this.
- The old soft "vanilla" mode (a per-tweak-storage flag from the retired
  `mode-switcher` tweak that suppressed tweak loading without unpatching) is
  gone; a stale persisted value is cleaned up at runtime startup. "All tweaks
  off without unpatching" remains available via safe-mode.

## Update handling

When Codex auto-updates via Sparkle:

1. Sparkle downloads a new Codex.app and replaces ours on disk.
2. Our patch is gone; the new app launches normally.
3. Our launchd / systemd / scheduled-task watcher fires (macOS and Linux watch `app.asar`; Windows runs at logon).
4. The watcher runs `codex-plusplus repair --quiet`.
5. `repair` is idempotent: if the current asar hash still matches `patchedAsarHash`, it exits without touching the app; if the hash drifted after an update, it re-runs the install patch against the new app bundle.

## Codex++ self-updates

The watcher also runs hourly using the GitHub-installed local CLI at `~/.codex-plusplus/source/packages/installer/dist/cli.js`. It checks the latest Codex++ GitHub Release, downloads and rebuilds a newer release when available, then runs `repair`. When the app patch is intact but the installed Codex++ version in `state.json` is older than the running CLI, `repair` refreshes `<user-data-dir>/runtime/` and updates state. It does not modify user tweak folders.

Users can disable Codex++ runtime auto-updates from Settings → Codex Plus Plus → Config. The setting is stored in `<user-data-dir>/config.json`; app-update repair still works, but intact-app runtime refreshes are skipped while auto-update is disabled.

The Config page can also check for Codex++ updates manually. It reads GitHub release metadata and opens GitHub release pages for review.

## What's not protected against

- **A Codex update that changes the asar layout** (e.g., moves the entry script) will break our injection. The installer's `injectLoader` reads `package.json#main` so this should be robust to renames, but if Codex ever ships an executable that doesn't go through Electron's normal asar-loading path, we'd need new strategies.
- **A Codex update that changes the Settings DOM enough that our heuristics fail.** The runtime falls back to a console warning; tweak authors can register sections that simply don't appear until heuristics are updated.
- **Targeted anti-tamper.** Codex doesn't currently appear to do TOCTOU integrity re-checks at runtime. If they ever start, more work is required (LD hooks, MachO patching, etc.) — but this is a different threat model.
